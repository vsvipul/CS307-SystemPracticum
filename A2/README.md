## Problem 1
- Compile using ```g++ -pthread main.cpp``` and run using ```timeout 30m ./a.out > filename.txt``` .
- Compile the script using ```g++ -o script script.cpp``` and run on previously generated file using ```./script filename.txt``` to get the results.
- Our solution does not suffer from deadlock because odd philosophers pickup left fork first and even philosophers pickup right fork first.
- This also ensures that each philoshopher gets a fair chance to eat.
